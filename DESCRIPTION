Description: R package with functions and datasets to support inference with the open access book
            "An Introduction to Bayesian Thinking"  which is available online
             <https://statswithr.github.io/book> and the online videos for the
             "Statistics with R Specialization" <https://www.coursera.org/specializations/statistics>.  
             The package includes functions and 'shiny' applications for an introduction to Bayesian inference and decision making, including
             one and two sample inference for Gaussian and Binomial data.
             See <https://github.com/StatsWithR/statsr> for new releases.
